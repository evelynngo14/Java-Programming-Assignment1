//(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the fol-
//lowing 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
//ax + by= e
//ed- bf
//x =
//cx + dy= f
//ad- bc
//y=
//af- ec
//ad- bc
//Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
//3.4x + 50.2y= 44.5
//2.1x + .55y= 5.9
